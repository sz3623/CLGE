# CLGE: *Compressed LiDAR  geometry enhancement*

The KITTI sequences are compressed in the G-PCC reference software TMC13v22 with predictive tree geometry coding. A simple and effective post-processing framework is proposed to enhance the geometry quality, which is also extended to LiDAR upsampling and denoising.
